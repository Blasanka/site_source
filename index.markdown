I'm a freelance iOS developer, this is my website.

I love making all kinds of apps and have worked on over ten apps in four different App Store categories. Here's the [list of apps I worked on](/apps).

[I write](/articles) about Objective-C, Cocoa Touch (I'll soon write about [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)!), and music-making apps. 

I have an MSc in Computer Science from University College London and a BSc in Philosophy, Logic & Scientific Method from theÂ London School of Economics and Political Science.

I love Hackathons (big fan of [Music Hackday](http://new.musichackday.org/)). My hacks won awards at Music Hack Day Barcelona 2012 and at [LMI For All Hack Day](http://rewiredstate.org/hacks/lmi-4-all-modding-day).

I'm a beatboxer, I play bass guitar, I make music; you guessed it, I like to work with sound.
