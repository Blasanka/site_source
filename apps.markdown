>""Ninja Jamm is another example of creative thinking; this is another way for us to consume the music we love, creating something new as a result. We’ve seen several other remix apps before, however Ninja Jamm feels like the best and carefully thought out app so far."

##Titanic Calling

Titanic Calling offers an unusual insight into the final hours of Titanic, a visceral, real time experience of the Morse code signals transmitted between Titanic and nearby vessels summoned to her relief, against the backdrop of a map of the Atlantic ocean showing the trajectory of the ships and the movement of dawn towards the site of the tragedy.

<iframe class="imgur-album" width="480" height="420" frameborder="0" src="http://imgur.com/a/MwiIy/embed"></iframe>

The app uses a morse code generator featuring custom-made sound synthesisers that enable viewers to hear as well as watch the messages being transmitted.

##NYLPT

The NYLPT app presents a unique viewing, remixing our urban environments. Randomly generated sequences of Jason Evans's street photographs collected in New York, London, Paris and Tokyo – double exposures made in camera on film – are combined with a randomly evolving soundtrack generated through a combination of 17 synthesizers. 

NYLPT is a result of Evans's compulsive visual collecting alongside an informed and intuitive focus that frames reoccurring motifs in a process-driven work. Evans invests in chance, luck and persistence, randomly layering exposures on film in camera; what emerges are delightful surprises – the reward for not thinking too much – and a visual thinking matter that is both familiar and strange. 

I worked on the app's architecture, development, sound design, and testing.

##iPad app for the Paul Graham Exhibition at Le Bal Gallery

In association with Le Bal gallery in Paris, we developed an app to view six of photographer Paul Graham’s historically significant photo books. It was installed on tablets in a purpose-built Digital Book Room at Le Bal Gallery from 14 September to 9 December 2012. 

I worked on the app's architecture, development, and testing.

##AudioSteam

You've just inherited a most peculiar device from a relative you had long forgotten about. Your family had always said your Great Uncle was a mad man who dabbled in Sonic Alchemy. Obsessed with harassing sounds of an unearthly origin which he called "taming the audio steam"

Personal project done in collaboration with [Justin Marazita](http://marazita.com/).
