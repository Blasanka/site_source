##The Synthesis Toolkit in C++

https://github.com/thestk/stk

The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK) is a set of open source audio signal processing and algorithmic synthesis classes written in the C++ programming language. 

The STK was designed to facilitate rapid development of music synthesis and audio processing software, with an emphasis on cross-platform functionality, realtime control, ease of use, and educational example code. 

I helped improve the STK's support for iOS. 

##PocketSVG

https://github.com/arielelkin/PocketSVG

An Objective-C class that converts Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) into: `CGPaths`, `CAShapeLayers`, `UIBezierPaths`, or `NSBezierCurves`.

This makes it easy to create vector-based paths and shapes in your iOS or OS X apps.
